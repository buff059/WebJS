There is an easy way to check it.

Write a program in any language you choose, which will do the following

1) ./checker put 10.0.0.N flagID flag  -- stores secret string flag on your app running on host 10.0.0.N using flagID

2) ./checker get 10.0.0.N flagID flag -- get secret from your app running on host 10.0.0.N using flagID and compare it with flag

3) ./checker pwn 10.0.0.N -- attacks your application and prints 10 last stored secrets (flags)
